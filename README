Team 2, Golden Globes Assignment
Kristin Funch, Rosio Macedo, Luke Olney, Jacob Samson

Our project depends on the json, nltk, re, curses, BeautifulSoup, locale, urllib2, and subprocess libraries.

We did not consult with any repositories in creating our solution.

Our code is highly adaptable, both to other years of golden globes data and (with minimal changes) 
to other awards shows altogether. All core analysis of tweets is entirely based on scraped data 
and the tweet corpus, with the exception of some key golden globes and tweet related words 
(i.e. "Golden","RT","GoldenGlobes") used to eliminate high-frequency, unhelpful words from candidate selection. 
While the scraping and interface are golden-globe (but not year) specific, these concessions were 
necessary design choices to keep the solution concise and workable.
